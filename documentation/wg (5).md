    \*   Understand competitor strategies (marketing, product, pricing, distribution).  
    \*   Benchmark VinScan's performance against competitors.  
    \*   Identify opportunities for differentiation and competitive advantage.  
    \*   Improve overall market position.  
    \*   Identify gaps in the market and unmet customer needs.  
    \*   Identify potential threats
